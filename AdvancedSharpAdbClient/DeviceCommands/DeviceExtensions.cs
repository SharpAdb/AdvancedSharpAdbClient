            // entirely fixed length, and some of the fields can be empty, so it's almost impossible
            // to parse correctly.
            //
            // The alternative is to directly read the values in /proc/[pid], pretty much like ps
            // does (see https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/toolbox/ps.c).
            //
            // The easiest way to do the directory listings would be to use the SyncService; unfortunately,
            // the sync service doesn't work very well with /proc/ so we're back to using ls and taking it

            // Android 7 and above ships with toybox (https://github.com/landley/toybox), which includes
            // an updated ls which behaves slightly different.
            // The -1 parameter is important to make sure each item gets its own line (it's an assumption we
            // make when parsing output); on Android 7 and above we may see things like:
            // 1     135   160   171 ioports      timer_stats
            // 10    13533 16056 172 irq tty
            // 100   136   16066 173 kallsyms uid_cputime
            // but unfortunately older versions do not handle the -1 parameter well. So we need to branch based
            // on the API level. We do the branching on the device (inside a shell script) to avoid roundtrips.
